<p>In this month long series author Joel Marsh put together 31 lessons on UX fundamentals from key ideas to user psychology. This is part one of a two part project. I found this article to be special because the author is hoping to get more people learning and starting in UX design. </p>

<p>Favorite quote:</p>
<blockquote>The “Paradox of Choice” says: the more options you see, the less likely you are to choose any of them. So if you overload normal users with too many choices, they will freak out and run away screaming.</blockquote>
