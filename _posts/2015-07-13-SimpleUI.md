<p>After reading this article on the UI of the mobile app ねこあつめ I quickly became obsessed with the game!</p>

<p>Favorite quote:</p>
<blockquote>Obviously, not every app, SaaS or other product can be compared to a silly kitty game. But all the same, I think a non-English silly kitty game has a lot to teach us about good UI:
<ol>
<li>Make your affordances obvious enough that language isn’t needed (or use language as little as possible)</li>
<li>Create an experience where trial-and-error is inviting, forgiving, and easy to back away from</li>
<li>Keep options simple, few, and easy to select</li>
<li>Simple features lend to simple and enjoyable customer conversations, which lend to easy customer learning and increased word-of-mouth marketing</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of the shots I've grabbed that have made me awe with delight!</p>
