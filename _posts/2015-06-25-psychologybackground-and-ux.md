<p>I graduated from college with a BS in psychology and a minor in statistics. I planned to begin a career in behavioral research but somehow ended up in human resources doing data analytics. Running reports on employee turnover and benefits wasn't tickling my fancy so made the transition into web development.</p>

<p>I gravitated to UX instantly. The more I learned about UX the more I discovered how relevant my background was. UX involves many of the skills I already had in my tool belt. In my tool belt was:</p>

<ul>
<li>A basic understanding of cognitive psychology principles like perception, memory, and attention. These principles are the foundation of how a user might react and interact with an interface.</li>
<li>Heuristics. Heuristics is psychology term for mental shortcuts. These mental shortcuts help us make judgements and decisions quickly. These quick judgements and decisions can lead to bias and human error. Understanding Heuristics is helpful in user testing; for understanding general testing behavior.</li>
<li>Understanding of statistical research methods and analysis. User research and user testing is a form of psychological research. A participant is asked to perform a task, the obersvations are documented, and conclusions are drawn. Understanding empirical and ehtical research standards and finding significant information through analysis are beneficial.</li>
<li>Empathy! Empathy may not be the first thing that comes to a developers mind when creating an interface. But mastering the ability to empathise and the capacity to recognize emotions with a user is cruicial in user testing and building an interface that will make a user return. </li>
<li>My background in psychology and statistics. My background has taught me to take statistical results at face value. Results can be skewed to tell the story the researcher wants it to tell. A healthy dose of skepticism involves being concious of how the data was collected and interpreted.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Other facets of psychology also play a integral role of UX, such as decision making, memory, human learning, persusaion, social influence, and more. There is more to web design and development than just creating a beautiful website. Creating an interface that is easy to navigate and engaging is the key to a successful website or application.

<p>My psychology background allows me to be able to step back and think about the big picture and use my tool belt to explore differing viewpoints to understand behaviors. Any person with a psychology background and a yearning for a creative career could find a happy home in UX. UX allows me to combine my analytical and creative nature, and for that I love it!</p>
