<p>In this article from Creative Bloq author Henry Lewington speaks about trust, psychological triggers, and using the psychological force when designing your web site.</p>

<p>Favorite quote:</p>
<blockquote>Without stifling creativity, by offering familiar and recognisable patterns, a website will instantly put visitors at ease... or do the opposite. The site's purpose must be immediately clear. Is the site providing information or selling a product or service? Users must be able to easily move between pages of interest. Steering too far away from basic user expectations in an effort to differentiate, can actually be counterproductive.</blockquote>
